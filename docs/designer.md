# designer

Together with the development of the platform, we have
been developing a live programming environment to
allow you to build Déjà Vu apps graphically.

The Déjà Vu designer is still in alpha and we don't
have binary releases yet. But if you
want to give it a try, follow
[the instructions to install the Déjà Vu
repo source](https://github.com/spderosso/deja-vu#contributing)
and then [run it locally](https://github.com/spderosso/deja-vu/tree/master/designer).
