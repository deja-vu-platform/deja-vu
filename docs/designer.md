# designer

Together with the development of the platform, we have
been developing a live programming environment to
allow you to build re# apps graphically.

The re# designer is still in alpha and we don't
have binary releases yet. But if you
want to give it a try, follow
[the instructions to install the re#
repo source](https://github.com/spderosso/deja-vu#contributing)
and then [run it locally](https://github.com/spderosso/deja-vu/tree/master/designer).
