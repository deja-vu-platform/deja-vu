11/20/2016 test notes

things that I'd really like:
	a box (empty box component) so that I can set add sorts of background colors
	grouping and moving together
	changing text size significantly
	feedback on image loading or is name is not acceptable

things I did not like:
	working while zoomed then coming back results in incorrect placement of components
	grids seems to not be functioning correctly, adding components may not correctly update the grid
	menu and dragging handle may get hidden under other components

11/30/2016 issues
color change does not penetrate the recursive components
link between components not remembered
background color is not remembered
zoom does not work very well (ratios not zoomed)
list component disappears
need to consolidate the code into smaller chunks
need to update view to work with components (maybe view should be moved into component containers?)
resizing upwards does not change the top, left position, just the size!!
at a lot of places, using selected user component as opposed to a given component might cause problems
need ui components for moving up and down the stack order.
