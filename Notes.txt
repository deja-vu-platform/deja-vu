11/20/2016 test notes

things that I'd really like:
	a box (empty box component) so that I can set add sorts of background colors
	grouping and moving together
	changing text size significantly
	feedback on image loading or is name is not acceptable

things I did not like:
	working while zoomed then coming back results in incorrect placement of components
	grids seems to not be functioning correctly, adding components may not correctly update the grid
	menu and dragging handle may get hidden under other components

11/30/2016 issues
x color change does not penetrate the recursive components
link between components not remembered
	this is working but implem is skecthy and needs work
	only remembered to one level: needs to be fully recursive
	needs to be refreshed for changes to show
x background color is not remembered
x zoom does not work very well (ratios not zoomed)
x list component disappears
x need to consolidate the code into smaller chunks
x need to update view to work with components (maybe view should be moved into component containers?)
x resizing upwards does not change the top, left position, just the size!!
x at a lot of places, using selected user component as opposed to a given component might cause problems
x need ui components for moving up and down the stack order.
how to allow copies of the same component in multiple places (same id)?
	this is currently working, but implem is sketchy and needs work

1/10/2017 issues
x made "main" a property for the template object that the user can make instances of, but the implementation
is a bit sketchy because they are both "UserComponent"s. Might be actually better to seperate them into 
UserComponentTemplate and UserComponentInstance or something...
Here's the idea:
	Have two classes Template and Instance (or some other names)
	Instance has parentId and custom changes including styles and resize (maybe)
	Then in DISPLAY (which is already recursive), if it is of type instance, we read from the project
		(side note, if the user is deleting some UserComponentTemplate, we warn them that all uses of it will be deleted,
		and delete them as we find them (ie, can't find it in the Project))
	
	So, the allowed structure is
	
	BaseComponent (is like a base case)
	UserComponentTemplate: 
		BaseComponent + UserComponentInstance (ie, just a reference)
	UserComponentInstance: ref back to UserComponentTemplate

ALSO, change userCOMPONENT to userWidget
	underway

AND change WIDGET to DRAG-HANDLE
