## Missing Features
*In parenthesis is what's needed for the feature.*
- Filter events by time (search events by time widget)
- Pick location from list of MIT buildings (location from list widgetâ€¦if we want to support this)
- Search for events by location (show markers by location widget, but should probably move away from lat+lng)
- Ability to edit events (^)
- Only the event host can edit/cancel the event (^)
- Restrict MapMIT to the MIT community (authentication cliche - add regex to sign up)
- Filter events by public/group (depends on how group visibility is done)
