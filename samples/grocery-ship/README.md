# Grocery Ship

*A clone of a 6.170 project built with Deja Vu.*

## Overview
Grocery Ship facilities peer grocery delivery. Students from the same college can post requests for groceries they need. Students who are going shopping can then claim and fulfill these requests. Requesters specify how much they're willing to pay as a delivery fee and which pickup locations they prefer. Payments are made once delivery is complete and both parties indicate this.
