      <p class="question">Q: How does this work?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        We use four things from your
        <dv.link href="/personal">personal page</dv.link> to suggest people to
        you whom you might be interested in talking to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how far away they are from you</li>
        <li>your topics of interest</li>
        <li>how you want those topics to overlap with a conversation partner</li>
        <li>your calendar availability for the next week</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">
        You can find these suggestions on your
        <dv.link href="/dashboard">dashboard</dv.link> under "Your Suggestions."
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        From there, users who we suggest to you, and to whom you are suggested
        have access to the "about me" section, which you can also update from
        your personal page. You can then indicate your interest in further
        pursuing a conversation with another user by clicking on the
        "Interested?" checkbox. If the other user is also interested in you,
        and you're both ready for a connection, you'll be able to e-mail each
        other, either directly using your public e-mail address, or through
        Phoenix.

      <p class="question">
        Q: I have a very regular schedule. Why do I have to keep putting in my
        calendar availabilities every week?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Even the most regular schedules are interrupted by things like holidays
        and vacations, the occasional sick day, or just in general not feeling
        like interacting with people. We want availabilities listed to be
        accurate, since other users get suggestions based on yours! In the case
        that someone hits a busy time of year or just doesn't feel up to
        talking, we want this app to reflect that by defaulting to no
        availabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, to avoid suggesting someone to you who might only be able
        to meet three months from now, we will only suggest to you people who
        have availabilities that overlap with you in the upcoming seven days.
      </p>

    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question">
        Q: The calendar won't let me select certain times today!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Time machines are a luxury item, so we don't allow people to mark
        availabilities for times that have already passed. We also won't suggest
        you to users if you have overlapping availabilities in the past.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question">
        Q: Your app is messed up! I don't have any available times to meet my
        current connection!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">We connect two people who are interested in each other
        when they both have an overlap in availability in overlap. If those
        overlapping availabilities pass and there are no more, though, we won't
        just close your connection without your consent. If you'd like to meet
        up with someone who is available, you can close your connection. You'll
        still be able to interact with this person online via e-mail or through
        our app.</p>

    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question">Q: What is this journal thing? Can people read it?</p>
      <p class="answer">Other users can't read your journal. It's purely for you
        to be able to make notes. Did you feel kind of awkward talking to the
        person? Did you have a lot of fun? What do you think made these
        interactions the way they were? This journal also serves as a history of
        your past connections, when you made them, and when you closed them.

    <div class="question-answer">
      <p class="question">Q: Who are you guys, anyways?</p>
      <p class="answer">We're just three nerds getting through MIT one day at a
        time. This is the final project for 6.170, also known as Software
        Studio, also known as "How to Be a Good Web Designer and Full-Stack
        Developer." We see people who are struggling every day to connect with
        others, and to feel like those connections are meaningful in the crazy
        whirlwind of life, especially life at MIT. We hope this app helps with
        that.
