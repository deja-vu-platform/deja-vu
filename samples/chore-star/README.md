# Chore Star

*A clone of a 6.170 project built with Deja Vu.*

## Overview
Chore Star is an app to make it easier for parents to give chores to their children. Parents can create a list of chores that need to be done, and children can mark them as completed. Parents can then award stars to their children, which can be redeemed for rewards.
