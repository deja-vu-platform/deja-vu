      Accord is an application for music groups to propose, discuss, rate,
      and select songs for a setlist.
      <br />

      Accord is a great solution for musical groups to virtually come to an agreement
      on the songs to be performed at a gig.
      <br />

      Each member can go in and propose songs they are excited about.
      Other members can also rate and provide comments on the song proposals.
      After seeing all the feedback, the group admins can finalize the perfect
      setlist that all members will enjoy performing.
