## Cliches Used
- Auth
- Map
- Rating

## Missing Features
*In parenthesis is what's needed for the feature.*
- Delete spots (deletion, trivial and not worth spending research time on)
- Floor (persisted field)
- Up/Down Votes for Reviews (new cliche, probably)
- User reputation (new cliche, probably)
- Need both rating and comment for review (atomic forms)
- Require all fields to create spot (atomic forms)
- Click review author username to see profile (refactor ShowComment widget, or way to override its template)
- Show spots by creator (could bind with post, but thatâ€™s a bit hacky, seems like ownership is a general issue)
- Only one review per user (need to think about this more)
- Report spots (it's unclear what this did, if anything, in the original)
